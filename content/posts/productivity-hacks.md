In a world full of distractions, staying productive can be challenging. Here are some productivity hacks that have genuinely made a difference in my daily routine.

## The Pomodoro Technique

Work in focused 25-minute intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. This simple technique helps maintain high levels of concentration while preventing burnout.

### How to Use It:

1. Choose a task
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes
3. Work without interruption
4. Take a 5-minute break
5. Repeat

After four "pomodoros," take a longer 15-30 minute break.

## Time Blocking

Instead of working from a to-do list, assign specific time blocks to specific tasks. This creates structure and helps you be more realistic about what you can accomplish in a day.

## The Two-Minute Rule

If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. This prevents small tasks from piling up and becoming overwhelming.

## Minimize Decision Fatigue

Make fewer decisions by:

- Planning your week in advance
- Creating routines
- Batch similar tasks together
- Automating repetitive decisions

## Digital Minimalism

- Turn off non-essential notifications
- Use website blockers during focus time
- Keep your workspace (both physical and digital) clean and organized

## Conclusion

Productivity isn't about doing more—it's about doing what matters most effectively. Start with one or two of these techniques and see what works for you!
