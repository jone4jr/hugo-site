OEE is supposed to tell you the truth about your equipment performance. But sometimes, it lies.

## The 85% Lie

I walked into a facility where every line was running at 85% OEE. Management was proud. "We're world class!"

Except we were bleeding money, missing deliveries, and running constant overtime.

How could we have 85% OEE and still be failing?

The answer: We were measuring the wrong things.

## How OEE Lies

### Lie #1: Availability Includes Breaks

One facility counted breaks as "available time." Their 90% availability looked great until you realized they were only running 70% of the scheduled shift.

**The Fix**: Measure planned production time, not scheduled shift time. If the line should run 7 hours of an 8-hour shift, your baseline is 7 hours.

### Lie #2: Performance Assumes Perfect Conditions

Standard cycle time: 60 seconds. Actual average: 65 seconds. Performance: 92%.

Sounds good, right? Wrong.

That 92% assumes the cycle time is achievable. But what if the cycle time was set when the equipment was new, materials were better, and the product was simpler?

**The Fix**: Validate your ideal cycle time regularly. If you can't achieve it even when everything is perfect, it's not the right target.

### Lie #3: Quality Only Counts First-Pass

Some facilities only count first-pass yield. Scrap a part at operation 1? Rework it? Doesn't impact OEE.

This hides massive waste. I've seen 95% OEE lines producing 30% scrap at certain operations—but it all got reworked "downstream," so it didn't count.

**The Fix**: Track true first-pass yield from raw material to ship. Include rework time in your availability calculations.

## What Actually Matters

OEE is a tool, not the goal. The goal is making money by delivering quality products on time.

I learned this when I stopped celebrating OEE and started asking different questions:

- **Are we making money?** (Not just running equipment)
- **Are we delivering on time?** (Not just hitting throughput)
- **Are we producing quality?** (Not just passing inspection)

Sometimes the answer was improving OEE. Sometimes it was slowing down to improve quality. Sometimes it was running less to match customer demand.

## The OEE Conversation I Have Now

When I review OEE with teams, I ask:

1. **"What's stopping us from running?"** (Availability)
2. **"Why aren't we running at speed?"** (Performance)
3. **"Why are we making bad parts?"** (Quality)

Then we dig into root causes:

- If availability is low: Is it changeovers? Breakdowns? Material availability?
- If performance is low: Is it tooling? Operator skill? Equipment condition?
- If quality is low: Is it process capability? Training? Materials?

OEE tells us *what* is wrong. We need to figure out *why* and fix it.

## When OEE Doesn't Matter

Sometimes, OEE literally doesn't matter.

If you're a bottleneck operation, maximize OEE. You're constraining the entire facility.

If you're not the bottleneck? Running faster just creates inventory. Focus on flexibility and quality instead.

I once had a line running at 65% OEE. Management wanted it at 85%. I asked: "Why? We already have 3 days of inventory downstream. If we run faster, we just build more inventory."

We left it at 65% and used the time for cross-training, improvement projects, and quality initiatives. Better use of time than chasing a meaningless metric.

## The Real Metric

Want to know if your operations are healthy? Track this:

**Throughput Dollar Days** = (Order Value) × (Days Late)

This metric combines what actually matters: making money and delivering on time.

A facility with 95% OEE but 20% late deliveries? Failing.
A facility with 75% OEE but 100% on-time delivery? Winning.

## The Bottom Line

OEE is a useful diagnostic tool. But it's not the goal.

The goal is running a profitable operation that delivers quality products on time.

Use OEE to identify problems, not to prove you're world-class.

What's your experience with OEE? What other metrics do you find more useful?
