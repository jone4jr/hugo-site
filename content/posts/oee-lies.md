Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is supposed to be the ultimate metric for production performance. But after analyzing OEE across 17+ production lines, I've learned that the number itself often obscures more than it reveals.

## The OEE Formula Seems Simple

OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality

Sounds straightforward. But the devil is in the definitions.

## Where OEE Lies

### Lie #1: "We're Running at 85% OEE"

**The Reality:**
- What's your denominator? Calendar time? Scheduled time? Available time?
- Are you excluding "planned" downtime that's actually just poor scheduling?
- What about setup and changeover time?

I've seen identical production lines report 65% and 85% OEE - the only difference was how they calculated available time.

**The Truth:**
OEE means nothing without understanding the calculation methodology. The number is only useful for comparing periods on the SAME line with the SAME calculation method.

### Lie #2: "We Track OEE So We Know Where to Improve"

**The Reality:**
OEE gives you one number. It doesn't tell you:
- WHERE the losses are occurring
- WHICH losses to address first
- WHAT to do about them

**The Truth:**
OEE is a scoreboard, not a diagnostic tool. You need to decompose it into specific loss categories:

- **Availability Losses**: Breakdowns, changeovers, adjustments
- **Performance Losses**: Minor stops, slow cycles, startup losses
- **Quality Losses**: Scrap, rework, startup defects

Then Pareto the losses and attack the biggest buckets.

### Lie #3: "Our OEE Goal Is 85%"

**The Reality:**
Generic OEE targets are meaningless. The "world class" benchmark of 85% came from specific contexts:

- High-volume, low-mix operations
- Mature, optimized processes
- Minimal changeover requirements

If you're running 50+ part numbers on a line with frequent changeovers, 85% might be physically impossible - or economically nonsensical to pursue.

**The Truth:**
Set OEE targets based on:
- Your specific constraints
- Economic optimization (not maximum utilization)
- Customer demand patterns
- Changeover frequency

## What To Do Instead

### 1. Understand Your True Constraint

OEE only matters on your bottleneck resource. Optimizing OEE on non-constraints can actually HURT overall system performance (see Theory of Constraints).

**Real Example:**
I helped a facility stop obsessing over OEE on their fastest machine and instead focus on their constraint process. Overall throughput increased 20% even though the "OEE" on several lines went DOWN.

### 2. Decompose the Losses

Create a loss tree that breaks OEE into specific, actionable categories:

- Unplanned downtime by reason code
- Planned downtime by type
- Speed losses by cause
- Quality losses by defect type

Now you have something you can actually improve.

### 3. Focus on Time Studies, Not Just OEE

Sometimes the rated speed is wrong. Sometimes your changeover estimates are fantasy.

**Example:**
Found a line reporting 72% performance efficiency. Dug into cycle times and discovered the "ideal cycle time" was based on a time study from 5 years ago with different tooling. Actual achievable cycle time made the real performance 88%.

Were they underperforming, or was the baseline wrong?

### 4. Match Metrics to Business Goals

What actually matters to your business?

- On-time delivery?
- First pass yield?
- Cost per piece?
- Customer satisfaction?

OEE is a proxy for these things, but it's not always a good one. I've seen facilities with excellent OEE and terrible delivery performance because they optimized for utilization over flexibility.

## The Right Way to Use OEE

OEE is valuable when:

1. **Consistently calculated** across time periods
2. **Decomposed into actionable losses**
3. **Used comparatively**, not absolutely
4. **Balanced with other metrics** (cost, quality, delivery)
5. **Applied strategically** (constraints, not everywhere)

## The Bottom Line

Don't chase an OEE number. Understand your losses, prioritize the biggest opportunities, and improve systematically.

The goal isn't a high OEE - it's meeting customer demand profitably with minimal waste.

Sometimes those align. Often they don't.
