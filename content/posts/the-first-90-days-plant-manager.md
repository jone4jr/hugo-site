Taking over as Plant Manager was the most exciting and terrifying moment of my career. Here's what I learned in those crucial first 90 days.

## Day 1: Listen More Than You Talk

My first instinct was to prove myself by making changes quickly. Wrong move.

The best advice I got was from a mentor: "Spend your first 30 days listening." So I did:

- Walked the floor every day
- Asked operators what frustrated them
- Sat in on production meetings without talking
- Reviewed data without jumping to conclusions

What I discovered: The team knew the problems. They'd been telling the previous manager for months. They didn't need me to identify issues—they needed someone who would actually listen and act.

## Week 2: Your Team is Testing You

About two weeks in, a supervisor asked me to override a quality hold on a shipment. Customer was screaming, we'd miss the truck, "we've shipped worse before."

This was a test.

I walked to the floor, looked at the parts, and asked quality why they held them. Dimensions were out of spec. Would fail at customer. Could create a field issue.

I supported quality. We didn't ship. Customer was upset, but we overnighted conforming parts the next day.

Word spread fast. Quality knew I had their back. Production knew shortcuts wouldn't fly. That one decision set the tone for everything that followed.

## Month 1: Pick Your First Battle Carefully

You can't fix everything at once. Your first major initiative will define you.

I chose safety. Not because everything else was fine (it wasn't), but because:
1. Everyone agrees safety matters
2. It touches every department
3. Success is measurable
4. It builds trust

We implemented daily safety walks with leadership. Found and fixed hazards immediately. Celebrated teams with no incidents. Within 60 days, our incident rate dropped 40%.

More importantly, the team saw that I followed through. When I said we'd do something, we did it.

## Month 2: Start Building Your Leadership Team

By day 30, I knew who my players were:

- **The Builders**: Ready to improve, open to change
- **The Skeptics**: Good at their jobs, need proof before buying in
- **The Resisters**: Comfortable with status quo, fight every change

I spent month 2 investing in the Builders. Give them projects, authority, visibility. Show the Skeptics that change works. The Resisters either came around or found themselves increasingly irrelevant.

Hard truth: I had to move two people out of leadership roles. It was painful but necessary. The team's performance improved immediately.

## Month 3: Deliver a Win

By day 90, you need a visible win. Not something small—something the whole facility can see and celebrate.

For us, it was on-time delivery. We'd been at 78%, customers were threatening to pull business. We:

- Created a daily shipment meeting
- Built a visible scoreboard
- Removed bottlenecks
- Got production and quality working together

Within 90 days, we hit 95% on-time delivery. Customers noticed. The team was proud. We had momentum.

## What I Wish I'd Known

**1. Culture Beats Strategy**
You can have the best plans, but if the culture doesn't support execution, you'll fail. Focus on culture first.

**2. Overcommunicate Everything**
What feels like repetition to you is the first time most people are hearing it. Say it seven times in seven different ways.

**3. Visibility Matters**
Be on the floor. Be in meetings. Be visible. Your presence sets the tone.

**4. Quick Decisions Beat Perfect Decisions**
Make decisions quickly with 70% of the info. You can adjust later. Indecision kills momentum.

**5. Celebrate Small Wins**
People need to see progress. Celebrate every win, no matter how small.

## The Real Test

The first 90 days aren't about massive transformation. They're about:

- Building trust
- Setting direction
- Proving you'll follow through
- Creating momentum

Do those four things well, and you'll have the foundation to tackle the big challenges ahead.

What was your experience taking on a new leadership role? What would you add to this list?
