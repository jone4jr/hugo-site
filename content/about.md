## About Manufacturing Leadership & Consulting

In an era of increasing automation and AI, manufacturing still fundamentally depends on human expertise - especially in areas requiring physical presence, relationship management, and operational judgment that machines cannot replicate.

## Who I Am

I'm a manufacturing operations leader with 15+ years of hands-on experience managing high-volume production environments in the automotive supply chain. My background combines:

- **Operational Leadership**: Direct management of 17+ production lines
- **Quality Systems**: IATF 16949 and ISO 9001 implementation and maintenance
- **Technical Excellence**: Six Sigma Black Belt certification
- **Data Analytics**: Advanced Excel, Power Query, and operational reporting
- **Union & Non-Union Environments**: Experience with diverse workforce dynamics

## What Makes This Different

Most consultants offer one of two extremes:

1. **High-level strategy** with limited implementation support
2. **Technical expertise** without operational leadership experience

I bring both. I've done the work - managed shifts, implemented quality systems, prepared for customer audits, optimized production lines, and built reporting systems that operations actually use.

## My Approach

**Hands-On Implementation**
I don't just make recommendations and leave. I work alongside your team to implement changes, troubleshoot problems, and ensure sustainability.

**Relationship-Driven**
Manufacturing is fundamentally about people and relationships - with customers, suppliers, operators, and stakeholders. Success requires building trust and managing change effectively.

**Practical Reality**
I understand the gap between theoretical best practices and what actually works in a real production environment with real constraints, real people, and real customers.

**Data-Informed Decisions**
My Six Sigma training and technical skills mean every recommendation is backed by data analysis, but always balanced with operational judgment and feasibility.

## Why This Matters Now

As AI and automation advance, manufacturers face a critical question: What remains uniquely valuable about human expertise?

The answer is clear:

- **Physical World Understanding**: AI can't walk your shop floor and identify subtle process instabilities
- **Relationship Management**: Customers, suppliers, and teams require human connection and trust
- **Change Leadership**: Implementing improvements requires managing people through uncertainty
- **Contextual Judgment**: Every facility is different - cookie-cutter solutions rarely work
- **Accountability**: Regulatory and quality work requires human responsibility

## My Philosophy

**Operational Excellence Is Built, Not Bought**
Technology and tools help, but sustainable improvement requires building capability in your people and processes.

**Experience Matters**
There's no substitute for having lived through customer audits, production crises, quality issues, and operational transformations.

**Teaching Over Doing**
The goal is to make myself unnecessary by building your team's capability to sustain and continue improvements.

**Honesty Over Optimism**
I'll tell you what's realistic, not just what you want to hear. Trust is built on honest assessment and realistic commitments.
