# Hi, I'm Jared

I've spent over 15 years in manufacturing leadership, from supervising production lines to serving as Plant Manager for facilities with nearly 1,000 employees. Along the way, I've learned that leadership isn't something you find in a textbook—it's forged through real experiences on the shop floor.

## My Background

- **Current Role**: Plant Manager at Creative Foam, Dayton, OH
- **Previous Experience**: Manufacturing leadership at Adient managing facilities with 950+ employees
- **Certifications**: Six Sigma Black Belt, IATF 16949 Lead Auditor, Quality One Lean Manufacturing
- **Education**: Master of Finance (in progress), University of Cincinnati

## Why This Blog?

This blog exists because I wished someone had shared these lessons with me when I was starting out. Leadership in manufacturing comes with unique challenges—managing diverse teams, navigating union dynamics, implementing quality systems, driving continuous improvement, and making tough decisions under pressure.

Every post here comes from real experience. The successes, the failures, and everything in between. My goal is simple: help other leaders navigate the challenges I've faced and share what actually works in the real world of manufacturing operations.
