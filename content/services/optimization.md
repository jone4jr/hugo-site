## Equipment & Process Optimization

Every manufacturer leaves money on the table through hidden capacity constraints, inefficient changeovers, and suboptimal material flow. Our optimization services identify and eliminate these bottlenecks using proven methodologies and hands-on implementation.

### Optimization Services

**Capacity Constraint Identification**
- Theory of Constraints (TOC) analysis
- Bottleneck identification and exploitation
- Capacity modeling and scenario planning
- Investment prioritization for maximum ROI

**Changeover Time Reduction**
- SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) implementation
- Setup standardization and documentation
- Tooling and fixture optimization
- Operator training and performance tracking

**Material Flow Improvement**
- Value stream mapping
- Layout optimization
- Pull system implementation
- Inventory reduction strategies

**Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) Analysis**
- Comprehensive OEE tracking across production lines
- Availability, performance, and quality loss analysis
- Pareto analysis of downtime and waste
- Action planning for OEE improvement

**Predictive Maintenance Implementation**
- Transition from reactive to preventive maintenance
- Critical equipment identification
- PM schedule development
- Integration with production scheduling

### Real-World Experience

Having conducted OEE analysis across 17+ production lines and managed operational improvements in high-volume manufacturing, I understand:

- How to identify the true constraint (it's often not what you think)
- The difference between theoretical and achievable capacity
- How to implement changes without disrupting production
- What operators need to sustain improvements
- How to measure results and communicate value

### Why Physical Optimization Still Matters

AI and advanced analytics can process data, but optimization requires:

- Physical presence to observe actual flow and identify hidden waste
- Understanding of operator behavior and capabilities
- Knowledge of equipment quirks and limitations
- Experience with change management in manufacturing
- Ability to balance theoretical ideal with practical reality

### Our Approach

1. **Assessment**: Detailed analysis of current state
2. **Prioritization**: Focus on highest-impact opportunities
3. **Implementation**: Hands-on support through changes
4. **Validation**: Measure and confirm results
5. **Sustainability**: Build capability for continuous improvement

### Expected Outcomes

- 15-30% capacity increase through debottlenecking
- 30-50% reduction in changeover times
- 10-20% improvement in OEE
- Reduced inventory and improved cash flow
- Enhanced production scheduling flexibility
