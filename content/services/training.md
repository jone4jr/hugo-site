## Technical Training & Development

Manufacturing faces a massive skills gap. As experienced professionals retire, companies struggle to transfer critical operational knowledge to the next generation. Our training programs bridge this gap with practical, hands-on education focused on real-world application.

### Training Programs

**Quality Systems Training**
- IATF 16949 requirements and implementation
- ISO 9001 fundamentals
- Core Tools (APQP, FMEA, MSA, SPC, PPAP)
- Internal auditor certification preparation

**Statistical Process Control for Operators**
- SPC fundamentals in plain language
- Control chart interpretation and response
- Gage R&R and measurement system analysis
- Practical problem-solving with data

**Manufacturing Leadership Development**
- Transitioning from operator to supervisor
- Managing production teams effectively
- Root cause analysis and problem-solving
- Communication and conflict resolution
- Performance management

**Technical Skills for Operations**
- Excel and data analysis for manufacturers
- Power Query and automation for reporting
- Visual management and KPI dashboards
- Bridging shop floor and office communication

### Why Our Training Is Different

Most manufacturing training is either too theoretical or too basic. Our programs are designed by someone who has:

- Managed union and non-union production teams
- Implemented quality systems across multiple facilities
- Trained operators, supervisors, and managers
- Built reporting systems that actually get used
- Passed customer audits and certifications

### Training Delivery

- **On-site workshops**: Customized to your facility and challenges
- **Virtual sessions**: Cost-effective option for smaller groups
- **Hybrid programs**: Combination of classroom and shop floor application
- **Train-the-trainer**: Build internal capability for sustainability

### Unique Value

The combination of Six Sigma Black Belt certification, hands-on production management, and technical skills (Excel, Power Query, data analysis) is rare in manufacturing. This allows training that connects statistical rigor with practical application and effective communication.
