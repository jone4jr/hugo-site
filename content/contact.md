Whether you're facing a specific operational issue, preparing for a certification audit, or looking to build long-term capability, I'd be happy to discuss how my experience might help.

## What to Expect

**Confidentiality**
All discussions are held in strict confidence. I understand the sensitive nature of operational and competitive information.

**Honesty**
If I'm not the right fit for your needs, I'll tell you. My goal is to help, not to sell services that won't deliver value.

**Practical Focus**
I'm interested in understanding your real constraints - budget, timeline, team capability, customer pressure - not just the ideal state.

**Clear Communication**
You'll get straightforward assessments, realistic timelines, and transparent pricing. No consultant-speak or vague promises.
